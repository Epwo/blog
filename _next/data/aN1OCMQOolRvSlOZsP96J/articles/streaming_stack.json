How does the domain name stuff actually works ?\n\n# The hardware\nBecause I like doing stuff myself, and not to rely on some third-party ( and mostly to avoid paying ). I chose to try and host my own server at my home, so I took my old laptop from high school. Installed debian on it, and call it a go.\nTurns out, this old laptop was really too old. So i went ahead and bought an old (but powerful enough) computer on the marketplace. This one is powerful enough, and is the one currently in use till now!\n\n# The stack\n## Disclamer\nThis is obviously for movies, my and my family own physically ( via blue-rays or CDs ).
