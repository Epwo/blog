How does the domain name stuff actually works ?\n\n# The hardware\nBecause I like doing stuff myself, and not to rely on some third-party ( and mostly to avoid paying ). I chose to try and host my own server at my home, so I took my old laptop from high school. Installed debian on it, and call it a go.\nTurns out, this old laptop was really too old. So i went ahead and bought an old (but powerful enough) computer on the marketplace. This one is powerful enough, and is the one currently in use till now!\n\n# The stack\n## Disclamer\nThis is obviously for movies, my and my family own physically ( via blue-rays or CDs ). Downloading movies you don't own is illegal (I think?)\n\n## Schematic\n![the schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Epwo/articles/1d91301d9f3b6205b72fdb24dbcc969d7ea255a8/images/stream_stack/schematic.svg)\n\n\n## How it works ?\n\nEvery brick in the stack is talking with the next one, via simple REST API calls. (which are obviously secured, and needs auth tokens )\n\n*Work in progress*\n","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Epwo/articles/d9b4ed48e8e9c0a4c082673b9595e06ec3ebe2b2/images/stream_stack/stream_stack.png","theme":"Coding,DevOps","summary":"Explanation of the differents bricks used to make a media suite, for me and my family.
